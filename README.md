# Weather-Relay
Building a weather relay mesh network using LoRa and other low cost technologies

The RX and TX test files have been deprecated, as has the original "Hub Test" file- while useful, the project has moved past them. They are being kept for posterity.
The Hub file is currently designed as the transmitter, and eventually as the master controller for the relay network. The Receive file is being designed as the code for each node.
